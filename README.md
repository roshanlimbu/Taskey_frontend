## OpenAI Project Report Generation

You can now generate detailed project reports directly from the project dashboard. When you click the "Generate Report" button, the frontend calls the backend, which uses OpenAI GPT-4 to create a report based on the project and its tasks. The result is shown in an alert (or can be improved to show in a modal).

No manual prompt writing is neededâ€”the backend handles all prompt construction.
